That is, each command reads the previous commandâ€™s output. This connection
is performed before any redirections specified by command1.

cmd1 ->pipe ->outfile 1


if simple cmd :
	if built in => built in
	if !built in => execve

if multi cmd :
	cmd1 out1 | in cmd2 out 3

	cmd ->fd[1]->fd[0]->out1

	

	ls >out | fd[1]== fd[0]

	ls -> fd[1] === fd[0] > out
